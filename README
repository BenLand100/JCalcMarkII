This was intended to be a rewrite of an older project of mine but it never got
far beyond the core framework and simple GUI (as is the case with most of my
projects --- I get bored of them by that point). Regardless, it features some 
pretty awesome things, including a mathematica-esque kernel (without all the
bullshit), on the fly compilation of formulas using BCEL (worth a look, if just
for that), and some pretty high end (if I do say so myself) math parsing logic.
